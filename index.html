		<p> My name is Robin McKay. I have a background in film and animation and am new to the web design world. I like to tinker and repurpose things. Whether it be an old futon from the alley or a line of code that I ripped from a different project for my own. I like to tell stories, almost as much as I like pizza...and that's alot.</p>
